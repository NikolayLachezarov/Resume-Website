# Resume-Website
I want to build a website from scratch that can be used to apply for internships and has basic info about me

This will be used for my CAS as a creativity.
I hope to finish this under 2 months but I will not rush myself. 
My goal is to end up having a more unique resume and learn more how to code in HTML, CSS and JS
